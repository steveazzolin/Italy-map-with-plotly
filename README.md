# Italy-map-with-Plotly-and-Python
During a project of mine I faced the need to display geograpical information of people in a dataset. Thus I decided to create a map of regions in Italy emphasizing districts with a greater population (relatively to my dataset).

Looking Plotly APIs for maps It seems quite easy to do for the USA as all information are provided. But I faced some issues while creating the map of Italy. Some information were missing.
Here I aggregate all info needed to create such map, with references to resources that allowed me to complete the task.
